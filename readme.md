## Debugging and improving the extension

### Build

It is a gradle project so therefore it should be easy to build in any IDE. Forms were created using IntelliJ GUI Designer and so it requires the gradle plugin to generate the initialization code for the forms.

### Run

There's a non-well known burp feature that allows any user to fast reload an extension by doing ctrl+click in the extender checkbox which is helpful if - like me - you enjoy trial and error programming

## TODO

1. Hide the tabs
2. Save & Load tab name
3. Fix weird bug
